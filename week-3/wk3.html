    <h2> Welcome! </h2>
    <p> I am an Honors Student at CU Boulder graduating Fall of 2025 with a BA in Psychology with minors in Business, Creative Technology & Design and Public Health. <br> My interdisplinary studies gives me a unique lens for solving complex problems creatively.  </p>
<p> I’m interested in how behavioral science and design can power meaningful innovation—whether that’s through building digital tools that support healthier habits, designing ethical user flows, or launching startup projects from idea to MVP.</p>
