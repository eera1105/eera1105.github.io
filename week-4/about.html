<h1>About Me</h1>

<section>
  
<p><em>Hi! I'm Eera Vedavyas, an honors student at the University of Colorado Boulder studying Psychology with minors in Business, Creative Technology & Design, and Public Health.</em></p>


   
       
<p> I’m passionate about entrepreneurship, product management, and behavioral design where technology and human behavior intersect. I’m currently seeking opportunities in fast-paced, mission-driven environments where I can apply research, strategy, and design thinking to bring impactful ideas to life.</p>
 
<p> So far, I've explored this through
    <ul>
        <li> Developing NoSo's newsletter campaigns to promote mindful tech use </li>
        <li> Managing internal systems and content pipelines to improve team communication</li>
        <li> Supporting product and marketing experimentation at startups and student-led organizations</li>
    </ul>
</p>
</div>

</div>

<p> I’m drawn to environments that value creativity, experimentation, and empathy—and I’m excited to continue building products, experiences, and teams that make a difference.
</p>
<p><b>Let's build something that matters.</b></p>
